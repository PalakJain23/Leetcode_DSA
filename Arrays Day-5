Remove Element

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

----------------code--------------
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int k =0;

        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(nums[i] != val){
                nums[k] = nums[i];
                k++;
            }
        }

        return k;
    }
}


Next Permutation
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]

class Solution {
    public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        // Step 1: Find the first index i from the end such that nums[i] < nums[i+1]
        int i = n - 2;
        while (i >= 0 && nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]) {
            i--;
        }

        // Step 2: If such index i exists, find index j to swap with
        if (i >= 0) {
            int j = n - 1;
            while (nums[j] <= nums[i]) {
                j--;
            }
            swap(nums, i, j);  // Swap the values at i and j
        }

        // Step 3: Reverse the elements from i+1 to end
        reverse(nums, i + 1, n - 1);
    }

    private void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }

    private void reverse(int[] nums, int left, int right) {
        while (left < right) {
            swap(nums, left, right);
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
}
